The purpose of this project was to take existing code from a website and refactor it, making the website more optimized for search engines. 
I removed the <div> tags from the HTML because they are not semantic, and better, more descriptive tags have been introduced with HTML5. I
replaced these tags with a variety of tags including <header>, <footer>, <nav> and <section> tags. Additionally, none of the images in the HTML
had "alt" attributes. I added descriptive "alts" to each image, increasing the odds that the website will show up in search results when users 
search for keywords. Additionally, there was some redundant code in the ccs file that I eliminated.
